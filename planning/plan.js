//** THIS DETAILS MY PLAN FOR PROJECT 2 **//

// For my second project, I am going to build a Movie JSON API.

// I will be pulling my data from the Movie Database API that was listed 
// as an example in the project 2 readme file. 

//https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api --> this is the link for the API


// The models I will be using for this API are 1. Movie, 2. People, 3. Genres

// The Movie model properties include: 
// genres:
// title:
// id:
// release_date:
// runtime:
// revenue:
// popularity:
// tagline:
// original_language:
// budget:
// overview: 

//The People model properties include:
// name:
// id:
// gender:
// biography: 
// birthday:

//The Genres model properties include:
// name:
// id: 


//FIGURE OUT HOW TO INSERT PICTURE TO SHOW RELATIONSHIP MAP BETWEEN THE MODELS



// BRONZE PLAN:
// build a functioning api that meets the hard requirements: 3 models, use express
// and mongoose, implement CRUD functionality, deploy to heroku, etc.


//SILVER PLAN:
//create a fourth model
//seed the database? unless this is a requirement? check


//GOLD PLAN:
//add css and style the webpage
// maybe do some front-end stuff like the pokedex lab
